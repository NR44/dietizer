# Dietizer

Dietizer is a tool that takes anthropometrics along with other clinical data and automates complex calculations with 
proprietary formluas to help Dietitians work more efficiently. While this calculator can not take the place of a 
Registered Dietitian's clinical judgement, it can help them allocate their time for other tasks and help minimize
human error.

This was developed with constant feedback with a registered deitian with more than 15 years of clinical experience.
