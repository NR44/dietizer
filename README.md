# Dietizer

Dietizer is a tool that takes a person's information and makes calculations with proprietary formluas
to help Dietitians work more efficiently. While this calculator can not take the place of a Registered Dietitian's
clinical judgement, it can help them concentrate on something more important than crunching numbers.

This application was developed with constant feedback with a registered deitian with 15 years of experience in both 
ICU and NICU(ICU for babies).
